# rewrite-clj

__rewrite-clj__ is a library offering mechanisms to easily rewrite Clojure/EDN documents in a whitespace- and comment-preserving
way. It includes an EDN parser (based on [clojure.tools.reader](https://github.com/clojure/tools.reader)), a corresponding
printer, as well as an EDN-aware zipper implementation (based on [clojure.zip](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.zip-api.html)).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xsc/rewrite-clj.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xsc/rewrite-clj)

This project is similar to Christophe Grand's [sjacket](https://github.com/cgrand/sjacket). In fact, I found it hard to _use_
sjacket, partly because of the underlying data structure (a [parsely](https://github.com/cgrand/parsley)-generated tree including
unnecessary data like parentheses and maintaining values as strings instead of their Clojure pendants), but mostly because of the
missing documentation. For those with similar experiences: rewrite-clj is for you!

## Usage

__Leiningen ([via Clojars](http://clojars.org/rewrite-clj))__

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/rewrite-clj/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/rewrite-clj)

Auto-generated documentation can be found [here](http://xsc.github.io/rewrite-clj/).

### Parsing Data

The parser relies on [clojure.tools.reader](https://github.com/clojure/tools.reader) when
handling simple tokens and generates a custom node type representing EDN forms:

```clojure
(require '[rewrite-clj.parser :as p])

(p/parse-string "(defn my-function [a]\n  (* a 3))")
;; => <list:
;;      (defn my-function [a]
;;        (* a 3))
;;    >
```

These nodes can be analysed using functions in `rewrite-clj.node`:

```clojure
(require '[rewrite-clj.node :as n])

(n/tag form)          ;; => :list
(n/children form)     ;; => (<token: defn> <whitespace: " "> <token: my-function> ...)
(n/sexpr form)        ;; => (defn my-function [a] (* a 3))
(n/child-sexprs form) ;; => (defn my-function [a] (* a 3))
```

To convert the structure back to a printable string, use:

```clojure
(n/string form) ;; => "(defn my-function [a]\n  (* a 3))"
```

You can create a node from nearly any value using `coerce`:

```
(n/coerce '[a b c]) ;; => <vector: [a b c]>
```

Alternatively, by hand:

```
(n/meta-node
  (n/token-node :private)
  (n/token-node 'sym))
;; => <meta: ^:private sym>
```

See the [auto-generated documentation](http://xsc.github.io/rewrite-clj/rewrite-clj.node.html) for more information.

### Clojure Zipper

To traverse/modify the generated structure you can use rewrite-clj's
whitespace-/comment-/value-aware zipper operations.

```clojure
(require '[rewrite-clj.zip :as z])
(def data-string
"(defn my-function [a]
  ;; a comment
  (* a 3))")
(def data (z/of-string data-string))

(z/sexpr data)                       ;; => (defn my-function [a] (* a 3))
(-> data z/down z/right z/node)      ;; => <token: my-function>
(-> data z/down z/right z/sexpr)     ;; => my-function

(-> data z/down z/right (z/edit (comp symbol str) "2") z/up z/sexpr)
;; => (defn my-function2 [a] (* a 3))

(-> data z/down z/right (z/edit (comp symbol str) "2") z/print-root)
;; (defn my-function2 [a]
;;   ;; a comment
;;   (* a 3))
;; => nil
```

`rewrite-clj.zip/edit` and `rewrite-clj.zip/replace` try to facilitate their use
by transparently coercing between the node's internal representation (`<token: my-function>`)
and its corresponding s-expression (`my-function`).

See the [auto-generated documentation](http://xsc.github.io/rewrite-clj/rewrite-clj.zip.html) for more information.

## Sweet Code Traversal

### Example

`rewrite-clj.zip` offers a series of `find` operations that can be used to determine specific
positions in the code. For example, you might want to modify a `project.clj` of the following
form by replacing the `:description` placeholder text with something meaningful:

```clojure
(defproject my-project "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "Enter description"
  ...)
```

Most find operations take an optional movement function as parameter. If you wanted to perform
a depth-first search you'd use `rewrite-clj.zip/next`, if you wanted to look for something on
the same level as the current location, you'd employ `rewrite-clj.zip/right` (the default) or
`rewrite-clj.zip/left`.

Now, to enter the project map, you'd look for the symbol `defproject` in a depth-first way:

```clojure
(def data (z/of-file "project.clj"))
(def prj-map (z/find-value data z/next 'defproject))
```

The `:description` keyword should be on the same layer, the corresponding string right of it:

```clojure
(def descr (-> prj-map (z/find-value :description) z/right))
(z/sexpr descr) ;; => "Enter description"
```

Replace it, zip up and print the result:

```clojure
(-> descr (z/replace "My first Project.") z/print-root)
;; (defproject my-project "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
;;   :description "My first Project."
;;   ...)
;; => nil
```

### Handling Clojure Data Structures

rewrite-clj aims at providing easy ways to work with Clojure data structures. It offers
functions corresponding to the standard seq functions designed to work with zipper nodes
containing said structures, e.g.:

```clojure
(def data (z/of-string "[1\n2\n3]"))

(z/vector? data)                ;; => true
(z/sexpr data)                  ;; => [1 2 3]
(-> data (z/get 1) z/node)      ;; => #<token: 2>
(-> data (z/assoc 1 5) z/sexpr) ;; => [1 5 3]

(->> data (z/map #(z/edit % + 4)) z/->root-string)
;; => "[5\n6\n7]"
```
